We have developed a mobile app to facilitate close-range communication in places with minimal internet connectivity.
Communication among rescue teams and victims is often a significant hurdle in rescue operations. We have developed an application for smartphones (assuming significant number of people have smartphone) so that it can automatically detect and notify if some device is in range (by using Latitude and Location). Then it automatically adds the member to a group chat.
On starting the app, the user can see the group chat of their area. After signing in, they can also post messages. All messages are accompanied by sender's location, so that they can be located by rescue groups.
To do this we have used Android Studio.

In future, we plan to add follwing features 
1) Suppose you are a rescuer and you see n people in the app who need help. Now you want to rescue them. For that we can find an optimal way to reach all the n victims from your location in minimum time(shortest path). This can be integrated with google maps to provide direction instructions.
2) Viewing the users on a map, and a better UI for the chat interface.
3) Users will be able to upload pictures and videos.
4) We will also try to make this service available on other platforms.

The app supports sign-in with e-mail and password. In future we may also add other means.
